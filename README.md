# Notion Clone
<h1>Notion Clone</h1>
Welcome to the Notion Clone project! This is a web application that replicates some of the core functionalities of Notion, allowing you to write and format text with features such as bold, italic, headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists. The project is built using React, Typescript, Vite, and Tiptap.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: You can write and edit text just like in Notion, with the ability to apply formatting such as bold, italic, and more.

- **Headings**: Organize your content with different heading levels (Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3).

- **Bulleted and Numbered Lists**: Create lists to structure your information with bullet points or numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables us to create dynamic and interactive components.

- **Typescript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code readability and provides better tooling for large-scale applications.

- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight build tool that facilitates quick development and builds for modern web applications.

- **Tiptap**: A headless rich-text editor for Vue.js, which we adapt for our React-based Notion Clone project to handle the rich-text editing features.
